# WooCommerce-Widget-Interface

---

This repository serves to host a React.js based web app that allows for easy and elegant snippet generation for my [WooCommerce Embeddable Widget](https://github.com/zachhardesty7/woocommerce-widget). Built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Future revisions will generalize the code to be more user friendly and portable.
